# The original header is preserved below for reference.  It is noted that there
# is a "newer" version which differs in some cosmetic details (but actually
# stopped updates several years ago); we have decided to not change the header
# unless there is also a change in content.
#
# To further muddy the waters, it is noted that changes to this file as part of
# maintenance of ncurses (since 1996) are generally conceded to be copyright
# under the ncurses MIT-style license.  That was the effect of the agreement
# which the principal authors of ncurses made in 1998.  However, since much of
# the file itself is of unknown authorship (and the disclaimer below makes it
# obvious that Raymond cannot or will not convey rights over those parts),
# there is no explicit copyright notice on the file itself.
#
# It would also be a nuisance to split the file into unknown/known authorship
# and move pieces as they are maintained, since many of the maintenance changes
# have been small corrections to Raymond's translations to/from termcap format,
# correcting the data but not the accompanying annotations.
#
# In any case, note that almost half of this file is not data but annotations
# which reflect creative effort.  Furthermore, the structure of entries to
# reuse common chunks also is creative (and subject to copyright).  Finally,
# some portions of the data are derivative work under a compatible MIT-style
# license from xterm.

#
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE:
#
# This file describes the capabilities of various character-cell terminals,
# as needed by software such as screen-oriented editors.
#
# Other terminfo and termcap files exist, supported by various OS vendors
# or as relics of various older versions of UNIX.  This one is the longest
# and most comprehensive one in existence.  It subsumes not only the entirety
# of the historical 4.4BSD, GNU, System V and SCO termcap files and the BRL
# termcap file, but also large numbers of vendor-maintained termcap and
# terminfo entries more complete and carefully tested than those in historical
# termcap/terminfo versions.
#
# Pointers to related resources (including the ncurses distribution) may
# be found at <http://www.tuxedo.org/terminfo>.
#
# INTERNATIONALIZATION:
#
# This file uses only the US-ASCII character set (no ISO8859 characters).
#
# This file assumes a US-ASCII character set. If you need to fix this, start
# by global-replacing \E(B and \E)B with the appropriate ISO 6429 enablers
# for your character set.  \E(A and \E)A enables the British character set
# with the pound sign at position 2/3.
#
# In a Japanese-processing environment using EUC/Japanese or Shift-JIS,
# C1 characters are considered the first-byte set of the Japanese encodings,
# so \E)0 should be avoided in <enacs> and initialization strings.
#
# FILE FORMAT:
#
# The version you are looking at may be in any of three formats: master
# (terminfo with OT capabilities), stock terminfo, or termcap.  You can tell
# which by the format given in the header above.
#
# The master format is accepted and generated by the terminfo tools in the
# ncurses suite; it differs from stock (System V-compatible) terminfo only
# in that it admits a group of capabilities (prefixed `OT') equivalent to
# various obsolete termcap capabilities.  You can, thus, convert from master
# to stock terminfo simply by filtering with `sed "/OT[^,]*,/s///"'; but if
# you have ncurses `tic -I' is nicer (among other things, it automatically
# outputs entries in a canonical form).
#
# The termcap version is generated automatically from the master version
# using tic -C.  This filtering leaves in the OT capabilities under their
# original termcap names.  All translated entries fit within the 1023-byte
# string-table limit of archaic termcap libraries except where explicitly
# noted below.  Note that the termcap translation assumes that your termcap
# library can handle multiple tc capabilities in an entry. 4.4BSD has this
# capability.  Older versions of GNU termcap, through 1.3, do not.
#
# For details on these formats, see terminfo(5) in the ncurses distribution,
# and termcap(5) in the 4.4BSD Unix Programmer's Manual.  Be aware that 4.4BSD
# curses has been declared obsolete by the caretakers of the 4.4BSD sources
# as of June 1995; they are encouraging everyone to migrate to ncurses.
#
# Note: unlike some other distributed terminfo files (Novell Unix & SCO's),
# no entry in this file has embedded comments.  This is so source translation
# to termcap only has to carry over leading comments.  Also, no name field
# contains embedded whitespace (such whitespace confuses rdist).
#
# Further note: older versions of this file were often installed with an editor
# script (reorder) that moved the most common terminal types to the front of
# the file.  This should no longer be necessary, as the file is now ordered
# roughly by type frequency with ANSI/VT100 and other common types up front.
#
# Some information has been merged in from terminfo files distributed by
# USL and SCO (see COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS below).  Much information
# comes from vendors who maintain official terminfos for their hardware
# (notably DEC and Wyse).
#
# A detailed change history is included at the end of this file.
#
# FILE ORGANIZATION:
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry (this feature had to be sacrificed in order
# to allow standard terminfo and termcap syntax to be generated cleanly from
# the master format).  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.  The intent of the divisions is
# (a) to make it easier to find things, and (b) to order the database so
# that important and frequently-encountered terminal types are near the
# front (so that you'll get reasonable search efficiency from a linear
# search of the termcap form even if you don't use reorder).  Minor sections
# usually correspond to manufacturers or standard terminal classes.
# Parenthesized words following manufacturer names are type prefixes or
# product line names used by that manufacturers.
#
# HOW TO READ THE ENTRIES:
#
# The first name in an entry is the canonical name for the model or
# type, last entry is a verbose description.  Others are mnemonic synonyms for
# the terminal.
#
# Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>
# The part to the left of the dash, if a dash is present, describes the
# particular hardware of the terminal.  The part to the right may be used
# for flags indicating special ROMs, extra memory, particular terminal modes,
# or user preferences.
#
# All names should be in lower case, for consistency in typing.
#
# The following are conventionally used suffixes:
#	-2p	Has two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.
#	-am	Enable auto-margin.
#	-m	Monochrome.  Suppress color support
#	-mc	Magic-cookie.  Some terminals (notably older Wyses) can
#		only support one attribute without magic-cookie lossage.
#		Their base entry is usually paired with another that
#		uses magic cookies to support multiple attributes.
#	-nam	No auto-margin - suppress <am> capability
#	-nl	No labels - suppress soft labels
#	-ns	No status line - suppress status line
#	-rv	Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white)
#	-s	Enable status line.
#	-vb	Use visible bell (<flash>) rather than <bel>.
#	-w	Wide - in 132 column mode.
# If a name has multiple suffixes and one is a line height, that one should
# go first.  Thus `aaa-30-s-rv' is recommended over `aaa-s-rv-30'.
#
# Entries with embedded plus signs are designed to be included through use/tc
# capabilities, not used as standalone entries.
#
# To avoid search clashes, some older all-numeric names for terminals have
# been removed (i.e., "33" for the Model 33 Teletype, "2621" for the HP2621).
# All primary names of terminals now have alphanumeric prefixes.
#
# Comments marked "esr" are mostly results of applying the termcap-compiler
# code packaged with ncurses and contemplating the resulting error messages.
# In many cases, these indicated obvious fixes to syntax garbled by the
# composers.  In a few cases, I was able to deduce corrected forms for garbled
# capabilities by looking at context.  All the information in the original
# entries is preserved in the comments.
#
# In the comments, terminfo capability names are bracketed with <> (angle
# brackets).  Termcap capability names are bracketed with :: (colons).
#
# INTERPRETATION OF USER CAPABILITIES
#
# The System V Release 4 and XPG4 terminfo format defines ten string
# capabilities for use by applications, <u0>...<u9>.   In this file, we use
# certain of these capabilities to describe functions which are not covered
# by terminfo.  The mapping is as follows:
#
#	u9	terminal enquire string (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 DA)
#	u8	terminal answerback description
#	u7	cursor position request (equiv. to VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48 DSR 6)
#	u6	cursor position report (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 CPR)
#
# The terminal enquire string <u9> should elicit an answerback response
# from the terminal.  Common values for <u9> will be ^E (on older ASCII
# terminals) or \E[c (on newer VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# The cursor position request (<u7>) string should elicit a cursor position
# report.  A typical value (for VT100 terminals) is \E[6n.
#
# The terminal answerback description (u8) must consist of an expected
# answerback string.  The string may contain the following scanf(3)-like
# escapes:
#
#	%c	Accept any character
#	%[...]	Accept any number of characters in the given set
#
# The cursor position report (<u6>) string must contain two scanf(3)-style
# %d format elements.  The first of these must correspond to the Y coordinate
# and the second to the %d.  If the string contains the sequence %i, it is
# taken as an instruction to decrement each value after reading it (this is
# the inverse sense from the cup string).  The typical CPR value is
# \E[%i%d;%dR (on VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# These capabilities are used by tack(1m), the terminfo action checker
# (distributed with ncurses 5.0).
#
# TABSET FILES
#
# All the entries in this file have been edited to assume that the tabset
# files directory is /usr/share/tabset, in conformance with the File Hierarchy
# Standard for Linux and open-source BSD systems.  Some vendors (notably Sun)
# use /usr/lib/tabset or (more recently) /usr/share/lib/tabset.
#
# No curses package we know of actually uses these files.  If their location
# is an issue, you will have to hand-patch the file locations before compiling
# this file.
#
# REQUEST FOR CONTACT INFORMATION AND HISTORICAL MATERIAL
#
# As the ANSI/ECMA-48 standard and variants take firmer hold, and as
# character-cell terminals are increasingly replaced by X displays, much of
# this file is becoming a historical document (this is part of the reason for
# the new organization, which puts ANSI types, xterm, Unix consoles,
# and vt100 up front in confidence that this will catch 95% of new hardware).
#
# For the terminal types still alive, I'd like to have manufacturer's
# contact data (Internet address and/or snail-mail + phone).
#
# I'm also interested in enriching the comments so that the latter portions of
# the file do in fact become a potted history of VDT technology as seen by
# UNIX hackers.  Ideally, I'd like the headers for each manufacturer to
# include its live/dead/out-of-the-business status, and for as many
# terminal types as possible to be tagged with information like years
# of heaviest use, popularity, and interesting features.
#
# I'm especially interested in identifying the obscure entries listed under
# `Miscellaneous obsolete terminals, manufacturers unknown' before the tribal
# wisdom about them gets lost.  If you know a lot about obscure old terminals,
# please go to the terminfo resource page, grab the UFO file (ufo.ti), and
# eyeball it for things you can identify and describe.
#
# If you have been around long enough to contribute, please read the file
# with this in mind and send me your annotations.
#
# COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS
#
# The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of
# California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.
#
# Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.
# It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they
# took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file
# and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.
#
# Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may
# serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous
# contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of
# graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.
#
# This file deliberately has no copyright.  It belongs to no one and everyone.
# If you claim you own it, you will merely succeed in looking like a fool.
# Use it as you like.  Use it at your own risk.  Copy and redistribute freely.
# There are no guarantees anywhere.  Svaha!

######## ICH/ICH1 VERSUS RMIR/SMIR
#
# Some non-curses applications get confused if both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir
# are present; the symptom is doubled characters in an update using insert.
# These applications are technically correct; in both 4.3BSD termcap and
# terminfo, you're not actually supposed to specify both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir
# unless the terminal needs both.  To my knowledge, no terminal still in this
# file requires both other than the very obsolete dm2500.
#
# For ncurses-based applications this is not a problem, as ncurses uses
# one or the other as appropriate but never mixes the two.  Therefore we
# have not corrected entries like `linux' and `xterm' that specify both.
# If you see doubled characters from these, use the linux-nic and xterm-nic
# entries that suppress ich/ich1.  And upgrade to ncurses!
#

######## VT100/ANSI/ISO 6429/ECMA-48/PC-TERM TERMINAL STANDARDS
#
# ANSI X3.64 has been withdrawn and replaced by ECMA-48.  The ISO 6429 and
# ECMA-48 standards are said to be almost identical, but are not the same
# as X3.64 (though for practical purposes they are close supersets of it).
#
# You can obtain ECMA-48 for free by sending email to helpdesk@ecma.ch
# requesting the standard(s) you want (i.e. ECMA-48, "Control Functions for
# Coded Character Sets"), include your snail-mail address, and you should
# receive the document in due course.  Don't expect an email acknowledgement.
#
# Related standards include "X3.4-1977: American National Standard Code for
# Information Interchange" (the ASCII standard) and "X3.41.1974:
# Code-Extension Techniques for Use with the 7-Bit Coded Character Set of
# American National Standard for Information Interchange."  I believe (but
# am not certain) that these are effectively identical to ECMA-6 and ECMA-35
# respectively.

#### VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48

# ANSI Standard (X3.64) Control Sequences for Video Terminals and Peripherals
# and ECMA-48 Control Functions for Coded Character Sets.
#
# Much of the content of this comment is adapted from a table prepared by
# Richard Shuford, based on a 1984 Byte article.  Terminfo correspondences,
# discussion of some terminfo-related issues, and updates to capture ECMA-48
# have been added.  Control functions described in ECMA-48 only are tagged
# with * after their names.
#
# The table is a complete list of the defined ANSI X3.64/ECMA-48 control
# sequences.  In the main table, \E stands for an escape (\033) character,
# SPC for space.  Pn stands for a single numeric parameter to be inserted
# in decimal ASCII.  Ps stands for a list of such parameters separated by
# semicolons.  Parameter meanings for most parametrized sequences are
# decribed in the notes.

# Notes:
#
# Some control characters are listed in the ECMA-48 standard without
# being assigned functions relevant to terminal control there (they
# referred to other standards such as ISO 1745 or ECMA-35).  They are listed
# here anyway for completeness.
#
# (A) ECMA-48 calls this "CancelCharacter" but retains the CCH abbreviation.
#
# (B) There seems to be some confusion abroad between CHA and HPA.  Most
# `ANSI' terminals accept the CHA sequence, not the HPA. but terminfo calls
# the capability (hpa).  ECMA-48 calls this "Cursor Character Absolute" but
# preserved the CHA abbreviation.
#
# (C) CHT corresponds to terminfo (tab).  Usually it has the value ^I.
# Occasionally (as on, for example, certain HP terminals) this has the HTJ
# value.  ECMA-48 calls this "Cursor Forward Tabulation" but preserved the
# CHT abbreviation.
#
# (D) terminfo (nel) is usually \r\n rather than ANSI \EE.
#
# (E) ECMA-48 calls this "Active Position Report" but preserves the CPR
# abbreviation.
#
# (F) CTC parameter values: 0 = set char tab, 1 = set line tab, 2 = clear
# char tab, 3 = clear line tab, 4 = clear all char tabs on current line,
# 5 = clear all char tabs, 6 = clear all line tabs.
#
# (G) CUP and HVP are identical in effect.  Some ANSI.SYS versions accept
# HVP, but always allow CUP as an alternate.  ECMA-48 calls HVP "Character
# Position Absolute" but retains the HVP abbreviation.
#
# (H) ECMA calls this "Cursor Line Tabulation" but preserves the CVT
# abbreviation.
#
# (I) DSR parameter values: 0 = ready, 1 = busy, 2 = busy, will send DSR
# later, 3 = malfunction, 4 = malfunction, will send DSR later, 5 = request
# DSR, 6 = request CPR response.
#
# (J) ECMA calls ED "Erase In Page". EA/ED/EL parameters: 0 = clear to end,
# 1 = clear from beginning, 2 = clear.
#
# (K) ECMA calls this "End of Guarded Area" but preserves the EPA abbreviation.
#
# (L) The GSM parameters are vertical and horizontal parameters to scale by.
#
# (M) Some ANSI.SYS versions accept HPR, but more commonly `ANSI' terminals
# use CUF for this function and ignore HPR.  ECMA-48 calls this "Character
# Position Relative" but retains the HPR abbreviation.
#
# (N) ECMA-48 calls this "Character Tabulation" but retains the HT
# abbreviation.
#
# (O) SGR parameter values: 0 = default mode (attributes off), 1 = bold,
# 2 = dim, 3 = italicized, 4 = underlined, 5 = slow blink, 6 = fast blink,

# 25 = turn off 5, 26 = proportional spacing, 27 = turn off 7, 28 = turn off
# 8, 29 = turn off 9, 30 = black fg, 31 = red fg, 32 = green fg, 33 = yellow
# fg, 34 = blue fg, 35 = magenta fg, 36 = cyan fg, 37 = white fg, 38 = set
# fg color as in CCIT T.416, 39 = set default fg color, 40 = black bg
# 41 = red bg, 42 = green bg, 43 = yellow bg, 44 = blue bg, 45 = magenta bg,
# 46 = cyan bg, 47 = white bg, 48 = set bg color as in CCIT T.416, 39 = set
# default bg color, 50 = turn off 26, 51 = framed, 52 = encircled, 53 =
# overlined, 54 = turn off 51 & 52, 55 = not overlined, 56-59 = reserved,
# 61-65 = variable highlights for ideograms.
#
# (P) SI is also called LSO, Locking Shift Zero.
#
# (Q) SI is also called LS1, Locking Shift One.
#
# (R) Some ANSI.SYS versions accept VPR, but more commonly `ANSI' terminals
# use CUD for this function and ignore VPR.  ECMA calls it `Line Position
# Absolute' but retains the VPA abbreviation.
#
# (S) MC parameters: 0 = start xfer to primary aux device, 1 = start xfer from
# primary aux device, 2 = start xfer to secondary aux device, 3 = start xfer
# from secondary aux device, 4 = stop relay to primary aux device, 5 =
# start relay to primary aux device, 6 = stop relay to secondary aux device,
# 7 = start relay to secondary aux device.
#
# (T) ECMA-48 calls this "Partial Line Forward" but retains the PLD
# abbreviation.
#
# (U) ECMA-48 calls this "Partial Line Backward" but retains the PLU
# abbreviation.
#
# (V) ECMA-48 calls this "Reverse Line Feed" but retains the RI abbreviation.
#
# (W) RM/SM modes are as follows: 1 = Guarded Area Transfer Mode (GATM),

# 6 = Erasure Mode (ERM), 7 = Line Editing Mode (LEM), 8 = Bi-Directional
# Support Mode (BDSM), 9 = Device Component Select Mode (DCSM),
# 10 = Character Editing Mode (HEM), 11 = Positioning Unit Mode (PUM),

# Mode (MATM), 16 = Transfer Termination Mode, 17 = Selected Area Transfer
# Mode, 18 = Tabulation Stop Mode, 19 = Editing Boundary Mode, 20 = Line Feed
# New Line Mode (LF/NL), Graphic Rendition Combination Mode (GRCM), 22 =
# Zero Default Mode (ZDM).  The EBM and LF/NL modes have actually been removed
# from ECMA-48's 5th edition but are listed here for reference.
#
# (X) Select Alternate Presentation Variants is used only for non-Latin
# alphabets.
#
# (Y) "Select Editing Extent" (SEE) was ANSI "Select Edit Extent Mode" (SEM).
#
# (Z) ECMA-48 calls this "Start of Guarded Area" but retains the SPA

#
# Abbreviations:
#
# Intro  an Introducer of some kind of defined sequence; the normal 7-bit
#        X3.64 Control Sequence Introducer is the two characters "Escape ["
#
# Delim  a Delimiter
#
# x/y    identifies a character by position in the ASCII table (column/row)
#
# eF     editor function (see explanation)
#
# FE     format effector (see explanation)
#
# F      is a Final character in
#             an Escape sequence (F from 3/0 to 7/14 in the ASCII table)
#             a control sequence (F from 4/0 to 7/14)
#
# Gs     is a graphic character appearing in strings (Gs ranges from
#        2/0 to 7/14) in the ASCII table
#
# Ce     is a control represented as a single bit combination in the C1 set
#        of controls in an 8-bit character set
#
# C0     the familiar set of 7-bit ASCII control characters
#
# C1     roughly, the set of control chars available only in 8-bit systems.
#        This is too complicated to explain fully here, so read Jim Fleming's
#        article in the February 1983 BYTE, especially pages 214 through 224.
#
# Fe     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that has an
#        equivalent representation in an 8-bit environment as a Ce-type
#        (Fe ranges from 4/0 to 5/15)
#
# Fs     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that is
#        standardized internationally with identical representation in 7-bit
#        and 8-bit environments and is independent of the currently
#        designated C0 and C1 control sets (Fs ranges from 6/0 to 7/14)
#
# I      is an Intermediate character from 2/0 to 2/15 (inclusive) in the
#        ASCII table
#
# P      is a parameter character from 3/0 to 3/15 (inclusive) in the ASCII
#        table
#
# Pn     is a numeric parameter in a control sequence, a string of zero or
#        more characters ranging from 3/0 to 3/9 in the ASCII table
#
# Ps     is a variable number of selective parameters in a control sequence
#        with each selective parameter separated from the other by the code
#        3/11 (which usually represents a semicolon); Ps ranges from
#        3/0 to 3/9 and includes 3/11
#
# *      Not relevant to terminal control, listed for completeness only.
#
# Format Effectors versus Editor Functions
#
# A format effector specifies how following output is to be displayed.
# An editor function allows you to modify the display.  Informally
# format effectors may be destructive; format effectors should not be.
#
# For instance, a format effector that moves the "active position" (the
# cursor or equivalent) one space to the left would be useful when you want to
# create an overstrike, a compound character made of two standard characters
# overlaid. Control-H, the Backspace character, is actually supposed to be a
# format effector, so you can do this. But many systems use it in a
# nonstandard fashion, as an editor function, deleting the character to the
# left of the cursor and moving the cursor left. When Control-H is assumed to
# be an editor function, you cannot predict whether its use will create an
# overstrike unless you also know whether the output device is in an "insert
# mode" or an "overwrite mode". When Control-H is used as a format effector,
# its effect can always be predicted. The familiar characters carriage
# return, linefeed, formfeed, etc., are defined as format effectors.
#
# NOTES ON THE DEC VT100 IMPLEMENTATION
#
# Control sequences implemented in the VT100 are as follows:
#
#      CPR, CUB, CUD, CUF, CUP, CUU, DA, DSR, ED, EL, HTS, HVP, IND,
#      LNM, NEL, RI, RIS, RM, SGR, SM, TBC
#
# plus several private DEC commands.
#
# Erasing parts of the display (EL and ED) in the VT100 is performed thus:
#
#      Erase from cursor to end of line           Esc [ 0 K    or Esc [ K
#      Erase from beginning of line to cursor     Esc [ 1 K
#      Erase line containing cursor               Esc [ 2 K
#      Erase from cursor to end of screen         Esc [ 0 J    or Esc [ J
#      Erase from beginning of screen to cursor   Esc [ 1 J
#      Erase entire screen                        Esc [ 2 J
#
# Some brain-damaged terminal/emulators respond to Esc [ J as if it were
# Esc [ 2 J, but this is wrong; the default is 0.
#
# The VT100 responds to receiving the DA (Device Attributes) control
#
#      Esc [ c    (or Esc [ 0 c)
#
# by transmitting the sequence
#
#      Esc [ ? l ; Ps c
#
# where Ps is a character that describes installed options.
#
# The VT100's cursor location can be read with the DSR (Device Status
# Report) control
#
#      Esc [ 6 n
#
# The VT100 reports by transmitting the CPR sequence
#
#      Esc [ Pl ; Pc R
#
# where Pl is the line number and Pc is the column number (in decimal).
#
# The specification for the DEC VT100 is document EK-VT100-UG-003.

#### ANSI.SYS
#
# Here is a description of the color and attribute controls supported in the
# the ANSI.SYS driver under MS-DOS.  Most console drivers and ANSI
# terminal emulators for Intel boxes obey these.  They are a proper subset
# of the ECMA-48 escapes.
#
# 0	all attributes off
# 1	foreground bright
# 4	underscore on
# 5	blink on/background bright (not reliable with brown)
# 7	reverse-video
# 8	set blank (non-display)
# 10	set primary font
# 11	set first alternate font (on PCs, display ROM characters 1-31)
# 12	set second alternate font (on PCs, display IBM high-half chars)
#
#			Color attribute sets
# 3n	set foreground color       / 0=black, 1=red,     2=green, 3=brown,
# 4n	set background color       \ 4=blue,  5=magenta, 6=cyan,  7=white
# Bright black becomes gray.  Bright brown becomes yellow,
# These coincide with the prescriptions of the ISO 6429/ECMA-48 standard.
#
# * If the 5 attribute is on and you set a background color (40-47) it is
#   supposed to enable bright background.
#
# * Many VGA cards (such as the Paradise and compatibles) do the wrong thing
#   when you try to set a "bright brown" (yellow) background with attribute
#   5 (you get a blinking yellow foreground instead).  A few displays
#   (including the System V console) support an attribute 6 that undoes this
#   braindamage (this is required by iBCS2).
#
# * Some older versions of ANSI.SYS have a bug that causes thems to require
#   ESC [ Pn k as EL rather than the ANSI ESC [ Pn K.  (This is not ECMA-48
#   compatible.)

#### Intel Binary Compatibility Standard
#
# For comparison, here are the capabilities implied by the Intel Binary
# Compatibility Standard for UNIX systems (Intel order number 468366-001).
# These recommendations are optional.  IBCS2 allows the leading escape to
# be either the 7-bit \E[ or 8-bit \0233 introducer, in accordance with
# the ANSI X.364/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 standard.  Here are the iBCS2 capabilities
# (as described in figure 9-3 of the standard).  Those expressed in the ibcs2
# terminfo entry are followed with the corresponding capability in parens:
#
#	CSI <n>k		disable (n=0) or enable (n=1) keyclick
#	CSI 2h   		lock keyboard
#	CSI 2i  		send screen as input
#	CSI 2l  		unlock keyboard
#	CSI 6m  		enable background color intensity
#	CSI <0-2>c		reserved
#	CSI <0-59>m		select graphic rendition
#	CSI <n>;<m>H	(cup)	cursor to line n and column m

#	CSI <n>D	(cud)	cursor left n characters
#	CSI <n>E		cursor down n lines and in first column
#	CSI <n>F		cursor up n lines and in first column
#	CSI <n>G	(hpa)	position cursor at column n-1
#	CSI <n>J	(ed)	erase in display
#	CSI <n>K	(el)	erase in line
#	CSI <n>L	(il)	insert line(s)
#	CSI <n>P	(dch)	delete characters
#	CSI <n>S	(indn)	scroll up n lines
#	CSI <n>T	(rin)	scroll down n lines
#	CSI <n>X	(ech)	erase characters
#	CSI <n>Z	(cbt)	back up n tab stops
#	CSI <n>`		cursor to column n on line
#	CSI <n>a	(cuu)	cursor right n characters
#	CSI <n>d	(vpa)	cursor to line n
#	CSI <n>e		cursor down n lines and in first column
#	CSI <n>g	(cbt)	clear all tabs
#	CSI <n>z		make virtual terminal n active
#	CSI ?7h 	(smam)	turn automargin on
#	CSI ?7l 	(rmam)	turn automargin off
#	CSI s     		save cursor position
#	CSI u   		restore cursor position to saved value
#	CSI =<c>A		set overscan color
#	CSI =<c>F		set normal foreground color
#	CSI =<c>G		set normal background color
#	CSI =<c>H		set reverse foreground color
#	CSI =<c>I		set reverse foreground color
#	CSI =<c>J		set graphic foreground color
#	CSI =<c>K		set graphic foreground color
#	CSI =<n>g	(dispc) display n from alternate graphics character set
#	CSI =<p>;<d>B		set bell parameters
#	CSI =<s>;<e>C		set cursor parameters
#	CSI =<x>D		enable/disable intensity of background color
#	CSI =<x>E		set/clear blink vs. bold background
#	CSI 7     	(sc)	(sc) save cursor position
#	CSI 8   	(rc)	(rc) restore cursor position to saved value
#	CSI H		(hts)	(hts) set tab stop
#	CSI Q<n><string>	define function key string
#				(string must begin and end with delimiter char)
#	CSI c   	(clear) clear screen
#
# The lack of any specification for attributes in SGR (among other things)
# makes this a wretchedly weak standard. The table above is literally
# everything iBSC2 has to say about terminal escape sequences; there is
# no further discussion of their meaning or how to set the parameters
# in these sequences at all.

# These were invented to take advantage of the IBM PC ROM character set.  One
# can compose an acsc string from the single-width characters as follows
#	"j{G4}k{G1}l{G2}m{G3}q{GH}x{GV}t{GR}u{GL}v{GU}w{GD}n{GC}"
# When translating a termcap file, ncurses tic will do this automatically.
# The double forms characters don't fit the SVr4 terminfo model.
#
# AT&T Extensions:
#
# The old AT&T 5410, 5420, 5425, pc6300plus, 610, and s4 entries used a set of
# nonstandard capabilities.  Its signature is the KM capability, used to name
# some sort of keymap file.  EE, BO, CI, CV, XS, DS, FL and FE are in this
# set.  Comments in the original, and a little cross-checking with other AT&T
# documentation, seem to establish that BO=:mr: (start reverse video), DS=:mh:
# (start dim), XS=:mk: (secure/invisible mode), EE=:me: (end highlights),
# FL=:LO: (enable soft labels), FE=:LF: (disable soft labels), CI=:vi: (make
# cursor invisible), and CV=:ve: (make cursor normal).
#
# HP Extensions
#
# The HP library (as of mid-1995, their term.h file version 70.1) appears to
# have the System V capabilities up to SVr1 level.  After that, it supports
# two nonstandard caps meml and memu corresponding to the old termcap :ml:,
# :mu: capabilities.  After that, it supports caps plab_norm, label_on,
# label_off, and key_f11..key_f63 capabilities like SVr4's.  This makes the
# HP binary format incompatible with SVr4's.
#
# IBM Extensions
#
# There is a set of nonstandard terminfos used by IBM's AIX operating system.
# The AIX terminfo library diverged from SVr1 terminfo, and replaces all
# capabilities following prtr_non with the following special capabilties:
# box[12], batt[12], colb[0123456789], colf[0123456789], f[01234567], kbtab,
# kdo, kcmd, kcpn, kend, khlp, knl, knpn, kppn, kppn, kquit, ksel, kscl, kscr,
# ktab, kmpf[123456789], apstr, ksf1..ksf10, kf11...kf63, kact, topl, btml,
# rvert, lvert.   Some of these are identical to XPG4/SVr4 equivalents:
# kcmd, kend, khlp, and kf11...kf63.  Two others (kbtab and ksel) can be
# renamed (to kcbt and kslt).  The places in the box[12] capabilities
# correspond to acsc chars, here is the mapping:
#
#	box1[0]  = ACS_ULCORNER
#	box1[1]  = ACS_HLINE
#	box1[2]  = ACS_URCORNER
#	box1[3]  = ACS_VLINE
#	box1[4]  = ACS_LRCORNER
#	box1[5]  = ACS_LLCORNER
#	box1[6]  = ACS_TTEE
#	box1[7]  = ACS_RTEE
#	box1[8]  = ACS_BTEE
#	box1[9]  = ACS_LTEE
#	box1[10] = ACS_PLUS
#
# The box2 characters are the double-line versions of these forms graphics.
# The AIX binary terminfo format is incompatible with SVr4's.
#
# Iris console extensions:
#
# HS is half-intensity start; HE is half-intensity end
# CT is color terminal type (for Curses & rogue)
# CP is color change escape sequence
# CZ are color names (for Curses & rogue)
#
# The ncurses tic utility recognizes HS as an alias for mh <dim>.
#
# TC Extensions:
#
# There is a set of extended termcaps associated with something
# called the "Terminal Control" or TC package created by MainStream Systems,
# Winfield Kansas.  This one also uses GS/GE for as/ae, and also uses
# CF for civis and CO for cvvis.  Finally, they define a boolean :ct:
# that flags color terminals.
#
######## CHANGE HISTORY
#
# The last /etc/termcap version maintained by John Kunze was 8.3, dated 8/5/94.
# Releases 9 and up are maintained by Eric S. Raymond as part of the ncurses
# project.
#
# This file contains all the capability information present in John Kunze's
# last version of the termcap master file, except as noted in the change
# comments at end of file.  Some information about very ancient obsolete
# capabilities has been moved to comments.  Some all-numeric names of older
# terminals have been retired.
#
# I changed :MT: to :km: (the 4.4BSD name) everywhere.  I commented out some
# capabilities (EP, dF, dT, dV, kn, ma, ml, mu, xr, xx) that are no longer
# used by BSD curses.
#
# The 9.1.0 version of this file was translated from my lightly-edited copy of
# 8.3, then mechanically checked against 8.3 using Emacs Lisp code written for
# the purpose.  Unless the ncurses tic implementation and the Lisp code were
# making perfectly synchronized mistakes which I then failed to catch by
# eyeball, the translation was correct and perfectly information-preserving.
#
# Major version number bumps correspond to major version changes in ncurses.
#
# Here is a log of the changes since then:

#	  for computing string-table lengths had a bug in it.
#	* pcansi series modified to fit comm-program reality better.
# 9.8.2 (Sat Sep  9 23:35:00 EDT 1995):

#	* I finally figured out how to translate ko capabilities.  Done.
#	* Added tvi921 entries from Tim Theisen.

#	  equivalent.
#	* Translate \E[0m -> \E[m in [rs]mso, [rs]mul, and init strings of
#	  vt100 and ANSI-like terminals.
# 9.9.3 (Tue Sep 26 20:11:15 EDT 1995):
#	* Added it#8 and ht=\t to *all* entries with :pt:; the ncurses tic
#	  does this now, too.

#	* Added hp2627, graphos, graphos-30, hpex, ibmega, ibm8514, ibm8514-c,
#	  ibmvga, ibmvga-c, minix, mm340, mt4520-rv, screen2, screen3,
#	  versaterm, vi500, vsc, vt131, vt340, vt400 entries from UW.

#	  older tic implementations.
#	* According to ctlseqs.ms, xterm has a full vt100 graphics set.  Use

#	* Freeze for ncurses-1.9.6 release.
# 9.10.1 (Sat Oct 21 22:18:09 EDT 1995):
#	* Add xon to a number of console entries, they're memory-mapped and
