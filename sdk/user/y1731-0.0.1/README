General Information
-------------------

The purpose of this file is to collect the building, installation,
and configuration procedures for the open source Y.1731 implementation. 

This file will be updated to mirror the changes in the source code.

Installation
------------

Pre-installed packages needed for the building: doxygen, and exuberant-ctags.

Folders (by default have to exist) and files in them:
/usr/local/etc/oam/config.xml
/usr/local/etc/oam/meg.xml 

These files can be copied from the source tarball and they 
are prefixed as example-*.xml

You can also use command line switch -c [name] to override the configuration file location. Same applies for the meg.xml with command line switch -m [name]

"make all" will build the binaries.

Note that there is a LIBS variable that contains
static option that is present to circumvent the fact that my build
machine has newer version of GLIBC than current version (0.8.5) of
Voyage Linux. This is not necessary in other situations.

"make install" Will build all binaries and install all but sources.
/usr/local/etc/oam/ is the default configuration location
/usr/local/sbin/ is the default binary directory 
/usr/share/man/man1 will contain the man pages.

"make uninstall" will remove all but the configuration files

"make purge" will remove all including the configuration files

"make binball" will compile all and create a tarbal containing all
plus the executables. 

"make tarball" will clean the directory and create a tarball of the sources.

This is software. Beware.
