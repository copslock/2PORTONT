 * Welcome to GoodNet Y.1731 Doxygen page.
 *
 * @section Introduction 
 * Primary function of Y.1731 OAM protocol is to provide fault detection
 * services for Ethernet networks, such as loss of connectivity, bit
 * errors, or timing deviations. Y.1731 pro-actively verifies the
 * connectivity by monitoring OAM messages coming from remote entities in
 * the network. Upon an error an alarm is raised.
 *
 * Y.1731 can perform in-service and out-of-service tests in order to
 * diagnose the network. In-service tests can be used to verify the path
 * integrity and for the identification of the on-path forwarding
 * entities. Out-of-service tests can be used for tasks such as measuring
 * the throughput of an unloaded path
 *
 * Y.1731 can measure the loss, one-way delay, two-way delay, delay
 * variation, and throughput.
